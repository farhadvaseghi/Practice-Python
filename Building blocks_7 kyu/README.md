## Description:


Write a class Block that creates a block (Duh..)

## Requirements

The constructor should take an array as an argument, this will contain 3 integers of the form [width, length, height] from which the Block should be created.

Define these methods:
```
`get_width()` return the width of the `Block`

`get_length()` return the length of the `Block`

`get_height()` return the height of the `Block`

`get_volume()` return the volume of the `Block`

`get_surface_area()` return the surface area of the `Block`
```
Examples
```
b = Block([2,4,6]) -> create a `Block` object with a width of `2` a length of `4` and a height of `6`
    
b.get_width() -> return 2
    
b.get_length() -> return 4
    
b.get_height() -> return 6
    
b.get_volume() -> return 48
    
b.get_surface_area() -> return 88
```
Note: no error checking is needed

Any feedback would be much appreciated

Good luck!
